# PIDplayground
a small app to allow experimentaion with PID parameters

Requires JDK v8 and ant (for building)

ant edit target relies on geany which requires Linux
however any editor can be used and the app itself should
work unmodified under and OS that provides version 8 of the JDK

## notes

Target sometimes moves faster than the PID can manage this is deliberate

P,I,D entry unlabeled and still thinking about a better more intuitive
way to edit these values bare in mind you might want to vary from 2 down
to 0.00001 which is impractical on for example a slider.

Reasonable ideas and suggestions most welcome
